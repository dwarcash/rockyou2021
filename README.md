# rockyou2021

Thanks to a Redditor who wishes to remain anonymous, I have obtained a copy of rockyou2021.txt and have prepared it for redistribution via torrent. The torrent contains rockyou.txt, 7z compressed into a split archive of two files, for a total compressed size of ~12.8 GB. The uncompressed size of rockyou2021.txt is a whopping ~92 GB, so be sure you have enough space. The torrent is currently being seeded at 20 Gbps, but please help maintain a healthy seed swarm.

You can use this magnet [link](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:JEQMEEFTBXT35RJ3GUTGXU7HP3HBU5P6&dn=rockyou2021.txt%20dictionary%20from%20kys234%20on%20RaidForums&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A6969%2Fannounce)

After downloading, you can uncompress these with the command 7z x rockyou2021.txt.7z.001, or on Windows simply right-click the first file (rockyou2021.txt.7z.001) and hit “Extract” - 7zip will be aware of the other split file and will extract the entire wordlist without problem.
